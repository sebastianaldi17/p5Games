# p5Games
A collection of 2D games made using p5.js
Harvard University has a class for game development at edX.
It touches on 2D games using LÖVE, a 2D Game Engine.
The thing is, I had my share of problems with LÖVE, and LÖVE uses Lua.
So why not try to port these to processing, since they work pretty similarly?
Hey, it gives me something to do during quarantine.

To run the games in here, you need to run your own server. I personally use node.js live-server for easy updates on refresh.
